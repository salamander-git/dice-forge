# **App Name**: Diceify

## Core Features:

- Dice Notation Input: Takes dice notation as input (e.g., 2d6+3) and displays the calculated results.
- Minimum Roll Display: Displays the minimum possible roll result based on the input dice notation.
- Maximum Roll Display: Displays the maximum possible roll result based on the input dice notation.
- Mathematical Average Display: Displays the average roll value calculated mathematically (with decimals).
- Roll Simulation: Button to simulate rolling the dice based on the provided formula and display a simulated value.
- Probability Distribution Generator: AI tool to generates a probability distribution graph showing the likelihood of each possible outcome for a given dice formula. Shows chance values per number on the graph.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 67%, 49%) - A vibrant blue (#3498DB) to evoke a sense of chance and excitement.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - A light gray (#F4F7FA) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that keeps the focus on the dice calculations.
- Accent color: HSL(30, 100%, 50%) - A bright orange (#FF9900) to highlight important interactive elements like the roll button and probability graph.
- Font Pairing: Use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' is used to create an element of computerization, whereas 'Inter' gives a clean feel for the text.
- Use simple, geometric icons representing dice faces to visually reinforce the app's purpose. Icons should be in the accent color.
- Arrange elements in a clear, logical manner with the dice input at the top, followed by calculated results, the probability graph, and finally the roll simulation button. Use a grid layout for consistent spacing.
- Implement subtle animations, such as a spinning dice animation when the 'Roll' button is pressed or a smooth transition when the probability graph is updated.
